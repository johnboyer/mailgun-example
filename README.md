mailgun-example 0.1
===============

*Wed, Sep 24, 2014*

I could'nt find a Mailgun example that used the latest version of the Jersey client SDK for sending messages. Being unfamiliar with Jersey, I thought I'd save someone some time and share this example.

I use Apache Ivy for dependency management, so I've included the `ivy.xml` file too.
